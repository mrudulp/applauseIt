## Background:

I have used Appium with Ruby & Python bindings. I had never before this assignment used java_client. So my experiences are summarised based on that.

## Experience Summary:

* Since the driver capabilities are hidden sending one maven command to both set capability as well as run test seemed very much convenient
* The documentation is kind of all over the place.
* Link to document at [http://docs.customertesting.applause.com](http://docs.customertesting.applause.com)  does not work
* Usage of Locators and Chunks in the project structure is still not clear.

## Overall:

Applause framework seemed more convenient over regular java_client for appium.
